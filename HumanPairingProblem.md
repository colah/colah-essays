I've only recently realized what an important factor the relationships I have with other people are on my happiness. It seems obvious, but I vastly underestimated it until recently. Friendship, feeling connected to people, and having peers are central to my happiness, and though I've never been in a romantic relationship, they seem to be even more important.

The relationships people can have with each other vary greatly in quality. Since one only ever meets a tiny fraction of the world's population, and only deeply interact with a tiny fraction of that, the fact of the matter is that most people never meet those they could have the best relationships with. I think that is tragic that these relationships never have a chance to actualize.

Of course, the people one meets aren't random. There's a variety of mechanisms which help people find better than random people to interact with. These include social clustering of similar people, social signals that help similar people find each other, and organizations which aggregate similar people, like universities.

It is striking to me that, in the modern age, with vast computational resources and sources of information about people, we should be able to do much better than socialization. And that if we could, that would be an extraordinarily positive thing.

Dating websites have worked on part of this problem -- probably the most important part. (I used to think dating websites were silly... Turns out I was the silly one!) It's a very hard problem: people aren't honest, even when they try to be, don't know what will make them happy in a relationship, and so on...

Most of the existing websites are utterly pathetic. The best attempt seems to have been OkCupid, but their techniques still seem pretty naive. Why hasn't better work been done, given how important a problem it is?

Dating or other human relationship websites have a natural monopoly: the more people using the service, the more possible parings there are, and the better a job it can do: the natural outcome is there being only one. This makes it very hard for anyone else to enter the space. So, presently, these websites are able to win by virtue of having a large user base. But that doesn't do much for society. We want competition and, in particular, innovation on the algorithms for pairing people.

Consider: The actual website part of the problem is utterly trivial with modern web development tools. The hard part is the pairing algorithms. We want lots of people to be able to experiment on paring algorithms. Further, there may be an argument to be had that for-profit organizations aren't really the group we want to be holding some of people's most intimate data.

Well, here's the idea. Start a non-profit relationship website. "We're on a mission to help people find the best relationships that can possibly exist." It should have a sincere mandate to help people find non-romantic relationships, if for no other reason than reducing awkwardness and stigma.

People could opt to make their (anonymized as best possible) data ("for love and science!"). People could access the full data set in a "behind the veil" manner, where they hand over specific queries (corelation between X and Y) and get the response, or paring algorithms for training that then integrate into the website. People could charge for use of their algorithm, so there would still be an incentive for people to work on the problem. Further, this would enable a wide range of people, including academics, to do the sort of research OkCupid did on their blog before being bought.

I don't think this is high enough on my priority list to actually work on this problem, but this seems like a good approach to me.
