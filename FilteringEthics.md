Moral consideration must be given whever

* Somehow, we've come up with a list of grounds that society widely agrees are unacceptable to discriminate on. Law generally protects against discrination on these grounds in contexts like employment. But what makes one ground deserving of this protection and not others? 
* Pattern: First a large scale moral injustice forms, the oppressed persuade the world they're being treated unfairly (generally by excercising power) and then we accept it as a fundamental moral principle.
* But what is the general case?
* Wester society generally supports the world being a meritocracy (with minor exceptions, like people advocating for affirmative action).
* But this is actually a much more complicated issue than it may initially seem because it is hard to actually know who is good at a job, and more accurate tests are often expensive. This is the problem of ethical filtering.
* So what principles are tied to ethically filtering people?

* The most common opinion about why gender, race, and so forth are immoral to use as filters seems to be that they are irrelevant factors. What gender you are doesn't make you a better or worse lawyer, nor does skin color effect ones competency as a programmer, so whoever is hiring employees ought not consider these factors.
* I think that this is simplistic and dangerous.
* If it turned out that for some highly desirable job, for which there is a great surpluss of candidates, women are 1.02 times more likely to be a good candidate than a male, is it ethical to throw out all of the men's resumes? What if it is 1.2 times? What if it is 3 times? What if it is 21 times?
