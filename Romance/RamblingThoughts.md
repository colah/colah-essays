Optimal Dating Strategies
---------------------------

A few mathematicians have considered optimal strategies for dating. Extremely simplified models of dating have optimal strategies, but things explode as one introduces even moderately realistic circumstances. Further, I have serious concerns about the utility functions these are optimal strategies under.

The general way the problem is discussed is as the [secretary problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem). In this problem, one is trying to get the best secretary out of a group of applicants. One can try the secretaries in sequence. Each candidate is objectively better or worse relative to others. Each time, one must either select that applicant, or move on to the next with no chance to return. Applicants always accept the job, and one is solely concerned with getting the *best* candidate. The optimal strategy is to reject the first n/e candidates (~36%) and accept the next best one.

It has been observed that one severe failing of this is that in dating, the other party may not accept you. A more realistic model is to [think of it as a dual secretary problem](http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/?p=1392), where both parties are mutually performing the same optimization. This problem is massively more complicated and eludes optimal strategies.

(My intuition for a good strategy, if one isn't only trying to get the best candidate, is as follows. For simplicity, we consider the homosexual case, so that there's only one candidate pool. Then one should use the sampling phase not only to determine what a good candidate looks like, but how could a candidate you are. Then you target everyone more than a certain amount better than you -- you exploit the intrinsic error margin in finding good candidate -- and gradually drift towards candidates that are worse than you as time goes on. For the heterosexual case, you need to do something more complicated to get a good sense of where you are in the applicant pool.)

This pictured universe is really quite tragic. With perfect information, the two best parties end up with their best match, and everyone else ends up in a suboptimal relationship. And if you aren't one of the two best parties, the only way for you to have your best outcome is for your partner to be ignorant of better options. It's a classic zero-sum game situation.

There are a lot of major assumptions in this model. To list a few:

 * Candidate quality is independent of the agent
 * Monogamy
 * Utility of outcome is solely determined by candidate selection

Dropping any of these introduces substantial doubt about the zero-sum nature of the game, but the first seems to be the most significant to me. In reality, it seems like what constitutes a desirable romantic partner varies massively from person to person. Better yet, in a lot of candidate dimensions, such as interests or values, similarity is generally attractive. This symmetry means that you will generally be more attractive to people who are attractive to you. An extreme version of this to imagine is that candidates all prefer those that are most similar to them, in which case the problem is extremely positive-sum.

The impact of allowing polygamy is complicated by the fact that it encompasses a large range of possibilities. Does each partner take a specific number of other partners, say two or three? Or perhaps they choose a way to distribute their time across various partners, turning it into some sort of differential game. But unless you allow everyone to have arbitrarily many relationships at no cost, which would admit a certain trivial solution, this doesn't actually seem to impact whether an outcome is a zero-sum or positive-sum game.


The fact that, in reality, the utility of an outcome isn't solely determined by who gets paired with who, is an aggregate of a large number of important issues that cast significant doubt on the optimality of a "sample then chose" strategy. 

* There isn't a single relationship that two people can form, but a large number of them, and the nature of their relationship can change over time. People sometimes invest a great deal of energy trying to shift their relationships in a positive direction (consider marriage counseling), but it seems that this is often very challenging. People's past actions set a context for future ones, and when the context is negative that seems to be very difficult for them to get past. It seems likely that very early interactions are important in the formation of this context.

* Even if the quality of a relationship was determined by the two people in it, that may not overshadow different costs of a strategy. It appears that there is a great deal of potential to hurt your partners in this matter if one isn't careful. Additionally, one can severely hurt themselves, and entering a relationship has a significant energy investment.

* Intuitively, I feel like there's something very special about the first relationship. That if I could make it be really awesome and work out, that would be best. That I might be less able to form deep relationships after it. Everyone I respect tells me this is ridiculous. H- proposed the test that I should try and find an expert who will argue for this position, and if I can't that is strong evidence against it -- I haven't tried yet.



Anti-Patterns
--------------

People do all sorts of really troubling things in relationships. If we note them, we can make sure to avoid them in ourselves and potential partners.


Rambles
---------

* Revealing romantic interest is a prisoners dilemma. Both reveal is awesome, neither reveals is sad, one reveals and the other doesn't really sucks.

* What is a good romantic partner? Makes you happy? Drives growth/productivity? Good reproductive partner (genetics & child rearing skills)? You don't fight?
