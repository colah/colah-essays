Optimal Dating Strategies
---------------------------

A few mathematicians have considered optimal strategies for dating. Extremely simplified models of dating have optimal strategies, but things explode as one introduces even moderately realistic circumstances. Further, I have serious concerns about the utility functions these are optimal strategies under.

The general way the problem is discussed is as the [secretary problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem). In this problem, one is trying to get the best secretary out of a group of applicants. One can try the secretaries in sequence. Each candidate is objectively better or worse relative to others. Each time, one must either select that applicant, or move on to the next with no chance to return. Applicants always accept the job, and one is solely concerned with getting the *best* candidate. The optimal strategy is to reject the first n/e candidates (~36%) and accept the next best one.

It has been observed that one severe failing of this is that in dating, the other party may not accept you. A more realistic model is to [think of it as a dual secretary problem](http://mat.tepper.cmu.edu/blog/?p=1392), where both parties are mutually performing the same optimization. This problem is massively more complicated and eludes optimal strategies.

(My intuition for a good strategy, if one isn't only trying to get the best candidate, is as follows. For simplicity, we consider the homosexual case, so that there's only one candidate pool. Then one should use the sampling phase not only to determine what a good candidate looks like, but how could a candidate you are. Then you target everyone more than a certain amount better than you -- you exploit the intrinsic error margin in finding good candidate -- and gradually drift towards candidates that are worse than you as time goes on. For the heterosexual case, you need to do something more complicated to get a good sense of where you are in the applicant pool.)

This pictured universe is really quite tragic. With perfect information, the two best parties end up with their best match, and everyone else ends up in a suboptimal relationship. And if you aren't one of the two best parties, the only way for you to have your best outcome is for your partner to be ignorant of better options. It's a classic zero-sum game situation.

There are a lot of major assumptions in this model. To list a few:

 * Candidate quality is independent of the agent
 * Monogamy
 * Utility of outcome is solely determined by candidate selection

Dropping any of these introduces substantial doubt about the zero-sum nature of the game, but the first seems to be the most significant to me. In reality, it seems like what constitutes a desirable romantic partner varies massively from person to person. Better yet, in a lot of candidate dimensions, such as interests or values, similarity is generally attractive. This symmetry means that you will generally be more attractive to people who are attractive to you. An extreme version of this to imagine is that candidates all prefer those that are most similar to them, in which case the problem is clearly extremely positive-sum.

The impact of allowing polyamory is complicated by the fact that it encompasses a large range of possibilities. Does each partner take a specific number of other partners, say two or three? Or perhaps they choose a way to distribute their time across various partners, turning it into some sort of differential game. But unless you allow everyone to have arbitrarily many relationships at no cost, which would admit a certain trivial solution, this doesn't actually seem to impact whether an outcome is a zero-sum or positive-sum game.


The fact that, in reality, the utility of an outcome isn't solely determined by who gets paired with who, is an aggregate of a large number of important issues that cast significant doubt on the optimality of a "sample then chose" strategy. 

* There isn't a single relationship that two people can form, but a large number of them, and the nature of their relationship can change over time. People sometimes invest a great deal of energy trying to shift their relationships in a positive direction (consider marriage counseling), but it seems that this is often very challenging. People's past actions set a context for future ones, and when the context is negative that seems to be very difficult for them to get past. It seems likely that very early interactions are important in the formation of this context.

* Even if the quality of a relationship was determined by the two people in it, that may not overshadow different costs of a strategy. It appears that there is a great deal of potential to hurt your partners in this matter if one isn't careful. Additionally, one can severely hurt themselves, and entering a relationship has a significant energy investment.

* Intuitively, I feel like there's something very special about the first relationship. That if I could make it be really awesome and work out, that would be best. That I might be less able to form deep relationships after it. Everyone I respect tells me this is ridiculous. H- proposed as a test that I should try and find an expert who will argue for this position, and if I can't that is strong evidence against it -- I haven't tried yet, but the fact that I don't have a very high confidence in succeeding doesn't bode well for this. I don't really intellectually believe this to be true, but I feel it very strongly emotionally.

Other Romance Game Theory
----------------------------

* [The Multi-Armed Bandit problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit): The mult-armed bandits are slot machines, with different pay outs which you can only learn by trying them. There's a tradeoff between exploring the possibilities and exploiting the best option you find. The problem generalizes to lots of scenarios where you are distributing resources between possibilities. For example, if you have multiple romantic candidates of unknown quality...

Anti-Patterns
--------------

People do all sorts of really troubling things in relationships. If we note them, we can make sure to avoid them in ourselves and potential partners.

* Lots of partners are subtly mean and coercive to each other.
* A lot of relationships don't seem to be between equals and have power dynamics. (I don't really understand being attracted to someone you don't consider your equal?)
  * On the other hand, some people enjoy that -- the extreme example being consensual BDSM relationships -- and I'm not trying to be judgmental.
  * I think I'm talking about something subtler...
* Some studies have found rather negative correlations age-disparity and relationship outcomes for the younger party -- the one I'm thinking of was either more than 5 or 7 years. "You aren't a lottery ticket" and all that applies, but...

Rambles
---------

* What is a good romantic partner? Triggers romantic attraction? Makes you happy? Makes you feel peaceful? Drives your growth/productivity? Good reproductive partner (genetics & child rearing skills)? You don't fight? Sex? Social status? A weighted combination of the above? It varies over time?

* I don't see much reason to think that Humans are particularly good at recognizing good partners, especially if "makes you happy" isn't the primary quality you are looking for in a partner. And especially when it comes to differentiating between fairly good and great partners -- clearly we're quite good at avoiding certain classes of horrible relationships!

* Most people never meet the people they could form the best relationship with. The larger the candidate pool, the greater the variation between the best match you are likely to meet and the best match out there. So, the present situation on Earth is extremely tragic. Computer association of partners is a promising solution. See Human Pairing Problem essay.

* Unpleasant men seem to be disproportionately successful in dating.
 * Purely anecdotal, may suffer from a number of biases, notably confirmation bias.

* A lot of people I deeply respect are polyamorous.
  * Polyamory is illegal in Canada: CCC s. 293 is title polygamy, but more general; see also Reference re: Criminal Code, s. 293, 2010 BCSC 1308. (I'm deeply skeptical that this would survive serious Charter scrutiny and think this is a Human rights violation. Unfortunately, the case law seems to have solely developed in the context of Bountiful, British Columbia.) In any event, *obviously* all these polyamorous people I deeply respect do not live in Canada. And even were I persuaded that polyamory is a good idea, I obviously wouldn't act on that while I remain in Canada.
  * Polyamory seems to have a bimodal distribution of relationship quality, with most relationships I'm aware of either being really admirable or horrifying. (This may just generally be true of relationships that are not socially normative. Standard deviation of relationship quality increases...)
  * There are moderately compelling moral arguments for polyamory.
  * In polyamory, one can have different partners that optimize for different types of "good" things in a romantic partner. For example, one partner might make one happy, while another might cause one to develop as a person.
  * It seems reasonable to think that whether polyamory is a good idea or not varies greatly from person to person.
  * I am personally uncomfortable with the idea, and pretty certain that it isn't for me, despite thinking they can be ethical.

* Non socially normative relationships present some interesting difficulties.
  * In average relationships, people have an external set of expectations about how to behave in a relationship. How to treat each other, expected behavior, etc. They may be quite problematic, including sexist, but they're external to the relationship. Obviously, these external expectations don't cover everything, but they give a sturdy framework.
  * Once you throw those away, things get much more confusing. Partners often have different expectations.
  * A power dynamic can form where one partner gets to decide all the expectations (and change them).
  * It seems like having an early conversation about this is a good idea in a relationship. Perhaps even independently writing out what one expects in the relationship.


Are Relationships a Good Idea?
--------------------------------

That relationships are a positive thing and an ultimate part of positive outcomes in life is quite broadly accepted, save a few edge cases like priesthood. This isn't at all surprising. Romantic relationships are essential to evolutionary success, and evolution has many tricks to keep us on this path.

But it isn't immediately clear to me that relationships are generally positive things in the long run. Answering if or when they are is clearly an extremely important question for my long term well being.

* Initial romantic attraction is a very pleasant experience, partly characterized by "labile psychophysiological responses to the loved person" by Fisher. However, it generally fades after about six months. The experience of romantic attachment is less obviously pleasant and more enforced by negative feelings to damage of the relationship. (See Fisher, 1998) Perhaps evolution gets us where it needs us with a carrot, then switches to a stick?

* Romantic relationships involve a tremendous risk of being very deeply hurt.

* Romantic relationships have a very deep time and energy investment.
  * Thinking of time as an inelastic resource is kind of naive, in my experience. So much of my time falls through the cracks, and I recapture it when I have the right motivations.
  * Early romantic attraction frequently involves a reduced need for sleep (because of increased dopamine?)...

* In romantic attraction / relationships, partners are often ready to under go radical changes in themselves to make themselves more appealing to the desired partner.
  * A visible example of this is that people often radically change their physical appearance at the beginning of relationships.
  * This cuts both for and against romantic relationships. They could both help one change in positive and negative ways, largely depending on (your perception of) your partner.

* Many friends and people that I respect tell me of how greatly relationships improved their quality of life. Others describe it not having much impact after a few months of feeling amazing. A small number are extremely negative about it. But I don't think any of them are a terribly objective source.


Productivity And Romance
-------------------------

(A lot of this is the same content as "Are Relationships a Good Idea?" from a different perspective.)

Naively, relationships seem very harmful to ones productivity. It's clearly a huge time investment. One can argue that many people's productivity would be harmed more by not being in a relationship (depression, sadness, obsessive thoughts about it)...

But "it's the least bad option" is not a very satisfying answer.

(I don't like evolution beating me into a corner with a dopageneric stick.)

So, the question is, can there be a positive relationship between romance and productivity. The following is brainstorming:

* Typically, couple's bonding time consists of things like watching movies, lazing about, talking about unimportant issues, etc. But if both parties are more interested in higher concerns, can that lead to them instead spending time learning or working on valuable projects?
  * Elements of this in D-&J- and E-&J- ??

* During romantic attraction, people change themselves to be more attractive to their partner, including changes to physical appearance, beliefs, ideals, etc. If attributes that make you attractive include things like ethics or intellectual curiosity...

* Could romance allow deeper collaboration through intellectual intimacy -- less filtering, more honesty about feelings?

Signaling
----------

One important and complicated issues around romantic relationships is the initial signaling that starts them. Expressing romantic interest in someone overtly is a costly action: it can hurt your relationship with them, with other people, make them feel uncomfortable, reduce your social standing, etc. Meanwhile, a positive outcome is fairly unlikely. So, people don't typically directly express romantic interest. Instead there's typically an exchange of increasingly stronger signals between them ("flirting"). This interplay reduces the risk of both parties, but is problematic if you can't read social queues or social skills aren't your strong point.

* Revealing romantic interest is a prisoners dilemma. Both reveal is awesome, neither reveals is sad, one reveals and the other doesn't really sucks.

* Initiating this sort of interaction typically falls to men, I think. Especially when it comes to escalating signals.
  * This seems really unfair.

* One deep concern I have about attempts to signal is making the person I am trying to express interest in uncomfortable or acting in a way that is hurtful to them. 
  * This is especially true in hacking/CS/math/physics communities that suffer from sexism and gender-biases if you're a heterosexual male. And especially hacklab where I am in a position of leadership (albeit very minor). The damage that could be done (awesome female is creeped out and leaves the community) seems to outweigh my interest.
  * There's really 2 separate problems:
  * (1) Making someone uncomfortable/unsafe. This connects directly to the ["schrodinger's rapist"](http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/) issue.
  * (2) Re-enforcing or triggering lots of sexist nonsense. (eg. That women are being respected in a community because of sexual/romantic appeal.)
  * H- & D- both think that I'm at no risk of doing this and should stop considering this.
  * subtle back and forth signaling can really help here.
  * Perhaps this has to do with the seeming disproportionate romantic success of people who aren't considerate of other people's feelings? If you aren't taking the risk of hurting them into consideration, signaling is much easier. (Again, this could just be confirmation bias.)

* Disinterest and business are a signal for quality. Conversely, desperation is a really bad signal: seeming desperate for friends or partners is severely unattractive. Use common sense.
  * This really, really complicates things.
  * This seems on net negative.
  * J- commented that some girls he knew would have rules like not accepting dates for Saturday any later than Wednesday, in order to emulate scarcity.

* H- views this as an important skill (one of many) that one develops on low value relationships so that one is ready for a potentially very good relationship.

* R- in blog describes a bunch of attempts at signaling that I would never have noticed. (How many people have tried to flirt with me and I didn't notice it?)

* D- thinks one can substantially ignore the other persons signaling if they can't understand it, and focus on sending their own signals.
  * I supposes this only works when only one party is socially unskilled.

* It would be really nice if the expected behavior could be less subtle. If we made the signal less costly, less personal, and less subtle, that would be a very positive thing.
  * Technology is a really big opportunity here.

* If you aren't very socially skilled and bad on picking up on queues, what can you do to avoid subtle signals?
  * Write about this publicly, so that they'll know they need to be less subtle?
  * Provide public information (an OkCupid profile?) so that they can build a better model of you and be more confident that you are of interest to them and that they'd be of interest to you?
  * Make relationship status public (eg. for me on 05/30/2013, single, has never dated) so that potential partner doesn't have to worry about whether there might be an existing relationship?
